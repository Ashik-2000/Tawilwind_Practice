                        I'm a passionate web developer with a BSc in Computer
                        Science & Engineering, currently diving deep into
                        font-end development with React. I love building clean,
                        scalable applications and constantly push myself to
                        understand the inner workings of the technologies I use.
                        I dream of becoming a full-stack developer and build
                        modern solutions.
