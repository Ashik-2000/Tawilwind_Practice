                    Hi, I'm a programming enthusiast passionate about turning
                    ideas into real-world web applications. Over the past 2
                    years, I've been actively learning and building projects in
                    web development â€” sharpening my skills through consistent
                    practice and self-driven development. <br />
                    I'm now looking for opportunities to contribute to impactful
                    projects, collaborate with real teams, and grow into a
                    high-value developer in the tech industry.
